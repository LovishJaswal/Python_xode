# 🐍 My Python Journey

A personal space where I’m documenting how I’m learning Python from scratch — the confusions, the breakthroughs, the inner details, and everything in between. This repo isn’t about perfect code; it’s about **real progress** and slowly building a rock-solid understanding of Python.

---

## 🎯 My Goal  
To truly understand Python — not just how to write code, but how Python itself works behind the scenes.  
My aim is to learn things like:

- How Python executes code internally  
- How imports work under the hood  
- How memory, references, and mutability behave  
- Why Python does what it does

Basically, I want to become someone who understands Python’s logic, not just its syntax.

## 📘 What This Repo Will Hold  
This repo will evolve with:

- My notes, learnings, and small realizations  
- Explanations in my own words  
- Mini experiments to test my understanding  
- Diagrams and flowcharts  
- Mistakes I made & what I learned from them  
- Anything that helps me understand Python better

It’s a journey — not a race.

## 📅 Daily Blog Logs  
I’m also writing daily blogs where I explain what I learned each day.

I’ll add the links here:

Day 0 - https://relearncode.hashnode.dev/dive-into-my-python-learning-adventure

Day 1 - https://day0001.hashnode.dev/pythons-inner-working-an-overview

## 🚀 Long-Term Vision  
Slow, deep learning.  
By the end of this journey, I want to:

- Understand Python’s internals confidently  
- Build projects without fear  
- Use Python comfortably for future fields like ML, DS, etc.  
- Look back at this repo and see how much I improved  
- Have a neat archive of my progress and thoughts

## 🧭 Final Note  
This repo is my learning diary. Some parts will be messy, some clean, but all of it will be genuine progress.  
If you’re reading this — welcome to the journey.
